                <h3>*Be creative when you are going to cook for kids, use colors with fruit and vegetables, you will be surprises to see that they will really like healthy food </h3>
                    <h3>*Involved kids in the kitchen, this can be a fascinating place for young kids.</h3>
                    <h3> *Even older kids might be intrigued by how baked goods and meals come together. It isn't always convenient to invite them into the kitchen to help,<br /> but consider doing so when time allows.</h3>
                    <h3>*You decide which foods to buy and when to serve them. Though kids will pester their parents for less nutritious foods,<br /> adults should be in charge when deciding which foods are regularly stocked in the house.</h3>
                    <h3>*Food preferences are developed early in life, so offer variety. Likes and dislikes begin forming even when kids are babies.<br /> You may need to serve a new food a fewÂ different times for a child to accept it. <br />Don't force a child to eat, but offer a few bites. With older kids, ask them to try one bite.</h3>
                <h3>*In this image I use chocolate cupcakes, occasional sweets are fine, but we put more fruits than cupcakes, to reduce the portion of cupcakes.</h3> <h3>Just try put more fruits than cupcakes on the same plate.</h3>
