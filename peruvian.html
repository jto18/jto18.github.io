        <div class="number"><h1><spam>1.</spam>Quinoa</h1></div>
        <h3>Quinoa has been grown for thousands of years, originally by the Incas and to this day in the Andes. While it’s eaten like a grain, it’s actually a seed with more than 120 varieties.
It’s loaded with antioxidants, is a good source of protein, and is coated with saponin, a chemical that research has found can help reduce cancer risks. Research also suggests quinoa may help manage blood sugar, and lower your risk for high blood pressure and high cholesterol. </h3>

        <div class="number"><h1><spam>2.</spam>Purple Corn</h1></div>
        <h3>Purple corn, largely unheard of in the U.S., is a main ingredient of Peru’s national drink, “chicha morada,” a health tonic found in practically every store there. The corn grows in the Andes and has one of the darkest shades of purple found on a plant.
Studies show that the compounds in purple corn have a variety of potential health benefits, and can help prevent cancer, diabetes, and heart disease.</h3>

        <div class="number"><h1><spam>3.</spam>Maca</h1></div>
        <h3>Maca is a plant that grows in the Andes. Its leaves and roots are edible and usually available as a dry powder.
It’s known for its potential to increase sex drive and energy. According to locals, the Incas took maca before they fought wars, says Manuel Villacorta, RD, author of Peruvian Power Foods and founder of Whole Body Reboot.
Maca helps your body regulate glucose and use more oxygen, in addition to assisting the pituitary gland with regulating hormones.

        <div class="number"><h1><spam>4.</spam>Camu Camu</h1></div>
        <h3>Camu camu is a berry that grows in the Amazon rainforest. You can’t eat the fruit raw, as it’s extremely sour — that’s because it contains 60 times more vitamin C than an orange. 
Instead, camu camu is often added to foods and smoothies as a powder. There is scientific evidence indicating that camu camu’s high levels of vitamin C could play a role in treating inflammatory conditions. </h3>

        <div class="number"><h1><spam>5.</spam>Aguaje</h1></div>
        <h3>Aguaje is a Peruvian fruit also found in the rainforest. It’s a yellow palm fruit with maroon scales on the outside. Like camu camu, it’s very rich in vitamin C.
The fruit, which is said to taste like carrots, is also known for its high vitamin A content.</h3>

        <div class="number"><h1><spam>6.</spam>Pichuberry</h1></div>
        <h3>Pichuberry, also called “aguaymanto” or goldenberry, is a small yellow berry that grows in the Andes. In addition to containing a variety of nutrients, one &frac34;-cup serving of the berries provides 39 percent of your vitamin D.</h3>
