        <p>*Eat 5 to 7 small portions of food during the day.</p>
           <p> *Drink plenty of water. </p>
                  <p>  *Check what vitamins you are eating and how these help your body. <a  href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20660118,00.html#vitamin-a-to-zinc-1">Vitamins in Food</a></p>
                         <p> *Make the Grab and Go Breakfast.</p>
            <p>*Buy glass jars for overnight oatmeals.</p>
       <p> *Always take a protein bar and a bottle of water with you.</p>   
              <p> *Buy a lunch container with compartments.</p>
       <p> *If you are going to buy, select fresh rather than processed foods, <br />Select baked rather than fried. </p>  
       <p> *Eat before grocery shopping.</p>
       <p> *Eat off smaller plates. </p>  
           <p> *Ask for salad dressing on the side.</p>
            <p><em>*Why to use Virgin coconut oil? </em>Coconut oil contains medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) or medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs).</p>
            <p>MCTs are smaller and more easily digested by your body, so they do not get stored as fat.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, vegetable cooking oils contain long-chain fatty acids or long-chain triglycerides (LCTs).</p><p> LCTs are larger and are difficult to break down, adding to your bodyâ€™s toxic burden.</p>
            
            <p>*Low cost Veggies: Brocoli, Mustard Green, Collards, Lettuce, Parsley,  Carrots, green onions, Cabbage. </p>
             <p> *Nyc has a variety of healthy groceries and restaurants, a lot of restaurants has a plate that is vegan or cooked with organic products</p>
            <p> *Set a time for your brekfast, lunch or dinner, do not wait until you are really hungry.</p>
            <p>*Buy products for pound, not for package at the supermarket.</p>
            <p> *Remember "you can not think well, love well, sleep well if one has not dined well"</p>
